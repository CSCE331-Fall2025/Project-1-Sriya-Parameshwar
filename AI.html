    <h1>AI in Healthcare: Transforming Diagnosis and Treatment</h1>

    <p>Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing the healthcare industry by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, personalizing treatment plans, and optimizing patient data analysis. As a computer science student exploring AI applications, healthcare presents a field with both societal impact and technical challenge.</p>

    <h2>1. Enhanced Diagnostics</h2>
    <p>Machine learning models, particularly deep learning, are achieving human-level accuracy in detecting diseases from medical imaging such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. AI tools can identify patterns invisible to the human eye, reducing misdiagnosis and accelerating early detection of conditions like cancer and neurological disorders.</p>

    <h2>2. Personalized Treatment</h2>
    <p>AI algorithms analyze vast datasets of genetic, clinical, and lifestyle information to recommend tailored treatment plans. By considering individual variability, AI enables precision medicine that improves patient outcomes and reduces adverse effects.</p>

    <h2>3. Patient Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>With the explosion of health data from electronic health records (EHRs), wearable devices, and mobile apps, AI systems help clinicians extract insights, predict disease progression, and support real-time decision-making.</p>

    <p>For students in computer science, working at the intersection of AI and healthcare offers a chance to build systems that can save lives, reduce costs, and increase healthcare accessibility worldwide.</p>
