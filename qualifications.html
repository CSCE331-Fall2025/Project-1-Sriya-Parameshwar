    <h1>Qualifications</h1>

        <h3>Tehnical Skills:</h3>
        <p>Languages: C++, Python, Java, Javascript, SQL, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Microsoft Azure, Git Version Control, Machine Learning frameworks, XGBoost</p>
        <p> I have used each of the languages in either an internship, engineering research, or course work</p>

        <h3>Tehnical Ares of Interst in Computer Science:</h3>
        <p>I’m deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and scalable software systems. I’m also</p>
        <p>passionate about data engineering and integration, with a focus on translating raw, high-dimensional datasets into actionable</p>
        <p>insights. This is something I got to delve deeply into over my SWE summer internship. Lastly, I have a great interest in products</p>
        <p>that merge technical depth with real-world usability. This is reflected in my research work of creating a machine learning tool to</p>
        <p>reduce drowning risk and my hackathon project of an AI Dementia Assistant.</p>
