  <h1>Projects</h1>

  <h3>AI Dementia Assistant (2025):</h3>
  <p>As part of the nationwide Tidal Hackathon hosted aat Texas A&M University, my partner and I developed an AI
    Dementia Assistant app.<br>The purpose of this app was to improve the quality of life of both caregivers and
    patients suffering from memory loss.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Building an app that integrated AI as part of its dataflow was important to me and I learned a lot through this
    development process.</p>
  <p>The data flow is as follows: First the caregiver uploads patient info through the front end. Then, the patient can
    audibly</p>
  <p>speak to the AI tool (speech-to-text) and Gemini 2.0 Flash generates a response to the patientâ€™s question using the
    patient info</p>
  <p>The response is then audibly played back to the patient (text-to-speech). This was a deeply gratifying project to
    work on since it</p>
  <p>has a real world impact and cause. I was very excited that my project won fourth place at the hackathon.</p>

  <h3>Internship Project: Dynamic Segmentation Tool (2025)</h3>
  <p>During my summer 2025 SWE internship with RCP Inc, I architected, implemented, and launched a web app that executed
    complex data</p>
  <p>analytics and risk modeling for the company's needs. The existing application was built in Microsoft Access,
    cluncky, and not scalable. </p>
  <p>I was tasked with creating a scalable website that would match the older functionality in a more seamless,
    streamlined way. Given the </p>
  <p>more flexible interface, I also added a few new data analysis features for easy usability. </p>
  <p>Tech Stack: Javascript, SQL, Node.js, Retool</p>

  <h3>Achoo - An Allergy Detection Web App (2023):</h3>

  <p>This is an accessibility-focused web app using HTML, Java, and GitHub to allow users to discover what allergens
    they are most likely</p>
  <p>allergic to. It has a calendar-like front end, enabling users to simply select the dates on which they had allergic
    reactions. Then, </p>
  <p>the backend logs each date and web scrapes reputable allergy reporting websites to compute what the user is most
    likely allergic to</p>
  <p>based on their selection trends. Data is collected for at least 2 weeks before a report is generated. This was a
    project that taught </p>
  <p>me a lot about locally hosting a website, integrating external website data into the web app, and the full software
    development cycle.</p>
