  <a href="https://devpost.com/sriya-param">AI Dementia Assistant</a>&nbsp;
  <p>As part of the nationwide Tidal Hackathon hosted at Texas A&M University, my partner and I developed an AI
    Dementia Assistant app.The purpose of this app was to improve the quality of life of both caregivers and
    patients suffering from memory loss.
  Building an app that integrated AI as part of its dataflow was important to me and I learned a lot through this
    development process.
  The data flow is as follows: First the caregiver uploads patient info through the front end. Then, the patient can
    audibly
  speak to the AI tool (speech-to-text) and Gemini 2.0 Flash generates a response to the patientâ€™s question using the
    patient info
  The response is then audibly played back to the patient (text-to-speech). This was a deeply gratifying project to
    work on since it
  has a real world impact and cause. I was very excited that my project won fourth place at the hackathon.</p>

  <a href="https://rcp.com/">Internship Project: Dynamic Segmentation Tool (2025)</a>&nbsp;
  
  <p>During my summer 2025 SWE internship with RCP Inc, I architected, implemented, and launched a web app that executed
    complex data
  analytics and risk modeling for the company's needs. The existing application was built in Microsoft Access,
    cluncky, and not scalable. 
  I was tasked with creating a scalable website that would match the older functionality in a more seamless,
    streamlined way. Given the
  more flexible interface, I also added a few new data analysis features for easy usability.
  Tech Stack: Javascript, SQL, Node.js, Retool</p>

  <h3>Achoo - An Allergy Detection Web App (2023):</h3>

  <p>This is an accessibility-focused web app using HTML, Java, and GitHub to allow users to discover what allergens
    they are most likely
  allergic to. It has a calendar-like front end, enabling users to simply select the dates on which they had allergic
    reactions. Then,
  the backend logs each date and web scrapes reputable allergy reporting websites to compute what the user is most
    likely allergic to
  based on their selection trends. Data is collected for at least 2 weeks before a report is generated. This was a
    project that taught 
  me a lot about locally hosting a website, integrating external website data into the web app, and the full software
    development cycle.</p>
